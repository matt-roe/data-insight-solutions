# About

Data Insight Solutions was founded in 2023 by Matthew Roe.

<br>

They key motivation to start his own company instead of continue his career in the IT and Software as a Service industry was simply, **people**.

<br>

People should be the true purpose of technology. Technology should enable more, and improved human experience. We have seen how technology has brought people together, from across the globe. That dear family member who once lived near, despite moving away is simply a phone call away! Now, you can even see their face. Communication tools are one good example of **technology for people**. There are many other examples of data bringing value to people's lives. Whether its weather forecasts or vehicle diagnostics, the possibilities are endless.

<br>

When technology is working for people, it can enable feats not normally possible. Let's do something great, together. Our approach is simple, we are not the experts of your business. We are the data experts, to help your team collect, automate, integrate, and display your business data in an impactful way.
