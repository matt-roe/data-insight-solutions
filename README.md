# SvelteKit static blog starter

This starter contains everything you need to get up and running with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) as a static site generator for your Markdown (and Svelte)-powered blog. [Check out the demo here](https://sveltekit-static-starter.netlify.app/), or view the [GitHub repo here](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter).

## Features

- üéâ **Fully up-to-date with SvelteKit 1.0!**
- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Super fast static site generation with hydration**. Every route is compiled down to static HTML and routed with (optional) JavaScript, thanks to the SvelteKit static adapter (pre-installed)
- üì¶ **Zero-config preloading** for automatic, fast background preloading of all top-level pages
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Markdown support** with a pre-configured blog
  - üìë **Pagination** included (_can customize posts per page_)
  - ‚úÖ **Category pages** included
  - üí¨ **Posts JSON API**
- üíÖ **Sass** pre-installed and -configured
- üìù **mdsvex** pre-installed--use Svelte components inside Markdown!
  - üîó **Rehype** plugins are included to generate unique heading IDs, for direct linking
- üì± **Responsive and accessible defaults**; includes a "skip to content" link and accessible mobile nav menu
- üîÑ **Page transitions** (_fancy!_)
- üîé **Basic SEO** for blog posts (_strongly recommend checking that out for yourself, though_)
- üì∞ **RSS feed** set up and ready to go (_though it could also likely benefit from some optimization_); just update `src/lib/config.js`

## Quick Start

Clone or download [this repo](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter), then install the dependencies and run the dev server:

```
npx degit https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter my-sveltekit-blog
cd my-sveltekit-blog
npm install
npm run dev -- --open
```

That should get a dev server up and running (assuming you have npm and Node installed already). Any saved changes to components and styles should auto-refresh blazingly fast.

Now all you need to do is:

- Update the `src/lib/config.js` file
- Drop your Markdown posts into `src/lib/posts`
- Optionally, customize the styles in `lib/assets/scss`

GLHF! Details below. üëá

(_Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter/issues/new) if you come across one._)

## Customization

Be sure to update `src/lib/config.js` to reflect your site's domain, preferences, etc. This is also where the nav menu can be updated.

**It's very important to update this file with the specific details of your site.** Info from this file is used in your RSS feed and SEO meta tags, so don't launch without updating it.

## Adding new posts

Adding new posts is as simple as dropping a new `.md` file into `src/lib/posts`. New posts will automatically show up on the site, be added to the posts API, and any category pages.

A few demo Markdown posts are included, and highlight some of the features of this starter. These demo posts can be updated or removed, but it may be best to use one as a starting point, just for the frontmatter properties.

If you want to use other frontmatter properties in the template (or just modify the layout), make changes in `src/routes/blog/[post]/+page.svelte`.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note: posts should have a `date` and an `excerpt` defined in the fronmatter.** They're sorted by `date`, and use `excerpt` in page meta tags (for SEO, social sharing, etc.) There are also other frontmatter properties used to enhance the site experience, like the `coverWidth` and `coverHeight`, which are used in the template to reserve space for the image, minimizing cumulative layout shift.

The starter will still work without `date` properties in your posts, but the sorting won't be right. Similarly, you can have posts without an `excerpt`, but your SEO/social previews will be sub-optimal.

Also: while there's no link to it by default, `/blog/category` exists as an archive of all your post categories.

### Pagination

Pagination automatically kicks in once you have more posts than the `postsPerPage` option in `src/lib/config.js`. This means you won't see the pagination right away unless you either change `postsPerPage` to a very low number, or add several more Markdown files to the `src/lib/posts` folder.

**Note:** both the normal `/blog` feed _and_ the category feeds at `/category/[category]` are automatically paginated.

### RSS

This starter also includes a basic RSS feed. It's very minimal, so you may want to tweak it depending on your XML feed needs, but it _does_ work out of the box.

Update the `config` details in `src/lib/config.js` to get your site's unique info correct. (You could also pull this info in other places, or add to it, to keep things consistent, but that's up to you.)

## Sass

**By default, all CSS in this starter is global.** It's located in `src/lib/assets/scss`, and all compiled into the `global.scss` file (which is then loaded into the global `+layout.svelte` file) automatically.

I didn't use component `<style>` blocks because, while component-based scoped CSS is very nice, it can also be hard to track down and update. Since this is a starter, I felt it was best to keep all the styles together in one place, and let you, the author, decide whether you want to keep them as they are, move to scoped CSS instead, or use a mixture.

## Site navigation menus

To add or remove pages from the site's navigation menu (in both the header and footer), edit the `navItems` array in `src/lib/config.js`. Items there will be automatically added to the main menu in the header and footer, and the mobile nav menu. They'll also have proper classes and ARIA attributes to show when they're the current page.

## Colors and Fonts

This starter has a default color palette (Credit to [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending)) and fonts, but you can easily override those here:

**Colors:** `src/lib/assets/scss/_vars.scss`
**Fonts:** `src/app.html` for the links, `_vars.scss` for the font names.

## Components

This starter includes only a handful of structural components, for the header, footer, site nav, posts lists (since lists of posts are repeated in several locations), and pagination (plus a couple that are actually just SVG icons).

You're welcome and encouraged to create your own (using them in Markdown is fun!); I just didn't want to push authors too far in any component direction right off the bat.

## Static files

Things that should just live in the site root of the finished site (like a `robots.txt` file, favicon, or maybe images) should go in the `static` folder. If you link to them, use the root path (e.g., `/images/my.png`, not `../static/images/my.png`).

(Placeholder images credit [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com); photographer names are in the file names.)

## Building, deploying and hosting

The build command (from package.json) is simply:

```
npm run build
```

You can use that as your build command if your repo is connected to a host like Netlify or Vercel, which automatically deploys.

Or, if you prefer, you can run `npm run build` locally to generate the static files. That will result in a `build` folder you can upload anywhere a static site can be hosted.

Use `npm run preview` _after_ a build to preview the built site locally.

## Further documentation

I assume at least a little bit of knowledge of SvelteKit and/or similar static site generators here, but be sure to read [the SvelteKit docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) for more info.

## Contributing

I've tried my best to make sure this starter is up to date with the latest SvelteKit, but I'm sure improvements can be made. Feel free to [visit the repo](https://github.com/josh-collinsworth/sveltekit-blog-starter) and submit a pull request, or [contact me directly](https://joshcollinsworth.com/contact).

# Sveltia CMS

Sveltia CMS is a Git-based lightweight headless CMS under development as a drop-in replacement for [Netlify/Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/). You can use it with any static site generator like SvelteKit, Eleventy, Next.js and Hugo to manage content as static files in a Git repository. The open source alternative to Netlify/Decap CMS is now in public beta ‚Äî with more features to come.

![Screenshot: Single-Line Migration from Netlify/Decap CMS](docs/screenshot-5.webp)<br>

## Features

Sveltia CMS is a Git-based lightweight headless CMS, which means:

- Git-based: The content is stored as static JSON, YAML or TOML files on your Git repository. No 3rd party database or API is involved. Your data is yours.
- Lightweight: The app is compiled as a single small JavaScript file served over a CDN. There‚Äôs no need to sign up for a service or install additional software.
- Headless: The CMS only takes care of raw data. You can read it and render the final content with your favourite framework.

Here are some highlights mainly compared to Netlify/Decap CMS:

### Compatible with Netlify/Decap CMS

- Ready to replace Netlify/Decap CMS _in some casual use case scenarios_ by updating one single line of code.
- Existing [configuration files](https://decapcms.org/docs/configuration-options/) can be reused as is.
- Various features are still missing though; [see the compatibility chart below](#compatibility) for details.

### Better UX

- Offering a modern, intuitive UI, with some inspiration from the Netlify/Decap CMS v3 prototype[^1].
- Immersive dark mode[^2].
- The screenshots above are worth a thousand words!

### Better performance

- Built completely from scratch with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) rather than forking React-based Netlify/Decap CMS. The app starts fast and stays fast. The compiled code is vanilla JavaScript; you can use it with any framework.
- Using the GraphQL API for GitHub by default to fetch contents quickly at once, so showing and searching entries and media are now instant. Saving entries and media is also much faster.
- Small footprint: less than 300 KB when minified and gzipped, compared to 1.5 MB of Netlify/Decap CMS.

### Better productivity

- Required fields, not optional fields, are clearly marked for efficient data entry.
- Integration with Pexels, Pixabay and Unsplash makes it easy to insert free stock photos into image fields[^8].
- You can [work on a local Git repository](#work-with-a-local-git-repository) without having to run a proxy server.
- Delete multiple entries and assets at once.
- Providing some keyboard shortcuts for faster editing. More to come!
  - Create a new entry: `Ctrl+E` (Windows/Linux) / `Command+E` (macOS)
  - Save an entry: `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) / `Command+S` (macOS)
  - Search for entries and assets: `Ctrl+F` (Windows/Linux) / `Command+F` (macOS)
- Solving various outstanding Netlify/Decap CMS bugs[^11].

### Better i18n support

- Making it easier to switch between locales while editing with just a click on a button.
- [Integrating DeepL](#use-deepl-to-translate-entry-fields) to allow translating text fields from another locale with one click.
- You can now [use a random UUID for an entry slug](#use-a-random-id-for-an-entry-slug), which is a good option for locales writing in non-Latin characters[^12].
- Solving limitations in Netlify/Decap CMS‚Äôs [list and object widgets](https://decapcms.org/docs/beta-features/#i18n-support) so that changes made with these widgets will be duplicated between locales as expected when using the `i18n: duplicate` field configuration[^7].
- Users can now choose their preferred UI locale.

### Collection enhancements

- You can choose a [custom icon for each collection](#use-a-custom-icon-for-a-collection)[^3].
- A [per-collection media folder](#use-a-custom-media-folder-for-a-collection) will now appear aside of entries.
- String values in YAML files can be quoted with the new `yaml_quote: true` option for a collection, mainly for framework compatibility[^9].

### Media library enhancements

- An all-new media library makes it easy to manage all your assets.
- Sort or filter assets by name or file type.
- View asset details, including size, dimensions, and a list of entries that use the selected asset.
- Upload multiple assets at once, including files in nested folders, by browsing or dragging & dropping them into the media library[^5].
- You can now navigate between the global media folder and a per-collection media folder[^6].

## Compatibility

While it‚Äôs not our goal to recreate all the features found in Netlify/Decap CMS, we plan to maximize compatibility before the 1.0 release so that more users can migrate to our modern alternative.

The GitLab backend is coming soon. We plan to add the Test backend as well for our demo site, but Azure and Bitbucket are unlikely to be supported, mainly due to the lack of an API method to fetch content in bulk. Later we may implement a performant Git Gateway alternative using GraphQL. |

## Getting started

### New users

Currently, Sveltia CMS is aimed at existing Netlify/Decap CMS users. If you don‚Äôt have it yet, follow [their documentation](https://decapcms.org/docs/add-to-your-site/) to add it to your site first. Then migrate to Sveltia CMS as described below.

As the product evolves, we‚Äôll implement the configuration editor and provide comprehensive documentation to make it easier for everyone to get started with Sveltia CMS.

Here are some starter templates for popular frameworks created by our contributors. More to follow!

### Migration

If you‚Äôre already using Netlify/Decap CMS with the GitHub backend and don‚Äôt have any custom widget, custom preview or plugin, migrating to Sveltia CMS is super easy. Edit `/admin/index.html` to replace the CMS `script` tag, and push the change to your repository:

```diff
-<script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"></script>
+<script src="https://unpkg.com/@sveltia/cms/dist/sveltia-cms.js" type="module"></script>
```

That‚Äôs it! You can open `https://[hostname]/admin/` as before to start editing. There is even no authentication process if you‚Äôve already been signed in with GitHub on Netlify/Decap CMS because Sveltia CMS uses your auth token stored in the browser. Simple enough!

That said, we strongly recommend testing your new Sveltia CMS instance first on your local machine. [See below](#work-with-a-local-git-repository) for how.

## Tips & tricks

### Move your site from Netlify to another hosting service

You can host your Sveltia CMS-managed site anywhere, such as [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). But moving away from Netlify means you can no longer sign in with GitHub via Netlify. Instead, you can use [our own OAuth client](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms-auth), which can be easily deployed to Cloudflare Workers, or [any other 3rd party client](https://decapcms.org/docs/external-oauth-clients/) made for Netlify/Decap CMS.

### Work with a local Git repository

You can use Sveltia CMS with a local Git repository, just like the [beta feature](https://decapcms.org/docs/beta-features/#working-with-a-local-git-repository) in Netlify/Decap CMS, but Sveltia CMS has simplified the workflow by removing the need for additional configuration (the `local_backend` property) and proxy server, thanks to the [File System Access API](https://developer.chrome.com/articles/file-system-access/) available in [some modern browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/api/window/showopenfilepicker#browser_compatibility).

1. Launch the local development server for your frontend framework, typically with `npm run dev`.
1. Visit `http://localhost:[port]/admin/index.html` with Chrome or Edge. The port number depends on your framework.
1. Click ‚ÄúWork with Local Repository‚Äù and select the project‚Äôs root directory once prompted.
1. Make some changes on Sveltia CMS.
1. See if the produced changes look good using `git diff` or a GUI like [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
1. Commit and push the changes if satisfied, or discard them if you‚Äôre just testing.

### Use a custom icon for a collection

As shown in the screenshot above, you can use different icons for collections in Sveltia CMS.

1. Visit the [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.platform=android) page on Google Fonts.
1. Search and select an icon, and copy the icon name displayed on the right panel.
1. Add it to one of your collection definitions in `config.yml` as the new `icon` property, like the example below.
1. Repeat the same steps for all the collections if desired.
1. Commit and push the changes to your Git repository.
1. Reload Sveltia CMS once the updated config file is deployed.

```diff
   - name: tags
     label: Tags
+    icon: sell
     create: true
     folder: data/tags/
```

### Use a custom media folder for a collection

This is actually not new in Sveltia CMS but rather an _undocumented_ feature in Netlify/Decap CMS[^4]. You can specify media and public folders for each collection that override the [global media folder](https://decapcms.org/docs/configuration-options/#media-and-public-folders). Well, it‚Äôs [documented](https://decapcms.org/docs/beta-features/#folder-collections-media-and-public-folder) as a beta feature, but that‚Äôs probably not what you want.

Rather, if you‚Äôd like to add all the media files for a collection in one single folder, specify both `media_folder` and `public_folder` instead of leaving them empty. The trick is to use an _absolute path_ for `media_folder` like the example below. You can try this with Netlify/Decap CMS first if you prefer.

```diff
 media_folder: static/media
 public_folder: /media

 collections:
   - name: products
     label: Products
     create: true
     folder: data/products/
+    media_folder: /static/media/products
+    public_folder: /media/products
```

In Sveltia CMS, those per-collection media folders are displayed prominently for easier asset management.

### Use DeepL to translate entry fields

Sveltia CMS comes with a handy DeepL integration so that you can translate any text field from another locale without leaving the content editor. To enable the high-quality, quick translation feature:

1. Sign up for [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api/) and copy your Authentication Key from DeepL‚Äôs Account page.
1. Go back to Sveltia CMS, click on the Account button at the top right corner, then click Settings.
1. Paste your key to the DeepL API Authentication Key field, and close the Settings dialog.
1. Open any entry, and you can now translate all fields or individual fields by selecting the Translate menu item.
1. If you have upgraded to DeepL API Pro, provide your new Authentication Key in the same way.

### Use a random ID for an entry slug

By default, the [slug for a new entry file](https://decapcms.org/docs/configuration-options/#slug) will be generated based on the entry‚Äôs `title` field. Or, you can specify the collection‚Äôs `slug` option to use the file creation date or other fields. While the behaviour is generally acceptable and SEO-friendly, it‚Äôs not useful if the title might change later or if it contains non-Latin characters like Chinese. In Sveltia CMS, you can easily generate a random [UUID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UUID) for a slug without a custom widget!

It‚Äôs simple ‚Äî just specify `{{uuid}}` (full UUID v4), `{{uuid_short}}` (last 12 characters only) or `{{uuid_shorter}}` (first 8 characters only) in the `slug` option. The results would look like `4fc0917c-8aea-4ad5-a476-392bdcf3b642`, `392bdcf3b642` and `4fc0917c`, respectively.

```diff
   - name: members
     label: Members
     create: true
     folder: data/members/
+    slug: '{{uuid_short}}'
```

### Set up Content Security Policy

If your site adopts Content Security Policy (CSP), use the following policy for Sveltia CMS, or some features may not work.

```csp
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
img-src 'self' blob: data:;
script-src 'self' https://unpkg.com;
connect-src 'self' blob: data:;
```

And combine the following policies depending on your Git backend and enabled integrations.

- GitHub:
  ```csp
  img-src https://avatars.githubusercontent.com https://raw.githubusercontent.com;
  connect-src https://api.github.com https://www.githubstatus.com;
  ```
- Pexels:
  ```csp
  img-src https://images.pexels.com;
  connect-src https://images.pexels.com https://api.pexels.com;
  ```
- Pixabay:
  ```csp
  img-src https://pixabay.com;
  connect-src https://pixabay.com;
  ```
- Unsplash:
  ```csp
  img-src https://images.unsplash.com;
  connect-src https://images.unsplash.com https://api.unsplash.com;
  ```
- DeepL API Free:
  ```csp
  connect-src https://api-free.deepl.com;
  ```
- DeepL API Pro:
  ```csp
  connect-src https://api.deepl.com;
  ```

If you have image field(s) and expect that images will be inserted as URLs, you may want to allow any source using a wildcard instead of specifying individual origins:

```csp
img-src 'self' blob: data: https://*;
```

### Self-host the CMS

Sveltia CMS is open source for sure! You can host it on your server rather than loading it from UNPKG, though it‚Äôs not recommended due to missing bug fixes. Simply copy the latest [`sveltia-cms.js`](https://unpkg.com/@sveltia/cms/dist/sveltia-cms.js) file from the CDN, or build it yourself:

1. Clone this Git repository.
1. Run `pnpm install && pnpm build` at the project root.
1. `sveltia-cms.js` will be generated under the `dist` directory.

Importing the CMS as an npm package is not supported yet.
